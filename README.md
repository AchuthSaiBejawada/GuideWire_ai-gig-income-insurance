AI-powered parametric insurance platform for gig workers using dynamic risk-based premium calculation (premium = base + risk_score × factor) and income-based payouts (7-day average model).

AI-Powered Parametric Insurance for Gig Workers

Problem
Gig delivery workers (Swiggy/Zomato) lose income due to external disruptions like heavy rain, pollution, extreme heat, and curfews. These events reduce their working hours, causing financial instability. Currently, they have no income protection.

Persona
Name: Rahul
Platform: Swiggy
City: Hyderabad
Average Daily Income: ₹700

we came up with a Solution

THE SOLUTION - 

We build an AI-powered parametric insurance platform that automatically compensates workers when external disruptions reduce their ability to work.

Weekly Premium Model (With Formula)

Premium is calculated using AI risk scoring:

premium = base_price + (risk_score × risk_factor)
Where:
base_price = ₹20
risk_score = 0 to 1 
risk_factor = ₹20
Example:
premium = 20 + (0.5 × 20) = ₹30/week
Income-Based Payout (Key Feature)

****We use a rolling 7-day average income model ****

daily_avg_income = total_income_last_7_days / 7
Example:
4900 / 7 = ₹700
Payout Formula:
payout = daily_avg_income × disruption_factor

Example:
700 × 0.6 = ₹420
Parametric Triggers
Claims are triggered automatically:

THE CONDITIONS FOR CLAIM

Rainfall > 50mm
Temperature > 45°C
AQI > 350
Curfew / zone closure


Workflow



	Worker registers

	AI calculates risk score & premium

	Worker buys policy

	System monitors weather

	Disruption detected

	Fraud checks applied

	Claim triggered automatically

	Payout simulated

	AI Integration

	Risk Prediction

	Calculates risk score

	Adjusts premium

	Fraud Detection

	Weather validation

	Location verification

	Activity analysis

 Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing Strategy

To handle fraud attacks like GPS spoofing:

1.Multi-Source Location Check

GPS + IP + historical patterns

2. Activity Validation

{ IF orders_delivered > threshold }
→ no payout

3. External Data Verification
Weather API
Pollution API

4. Fraud Scoring
fraud_score = f(location_mismatch, activity_drop, claim_frequency)

5. Anti-Collusion Detection

Multiple users from same location
Pattern-based fraud detection
